    <h1>Overview</h1>
    <p>Web development is the building and maintenance of websites; it’s the work that happens behind the scenes to make
        a website look great, work fast and perform well with a seamless user experience.

        Web developers, or ‘devs’, do this by using a variety of coding languages. The languages they use depends on the
        types of tasks they are preforming and the platforms on which they are working.

        Web development skills are in high demand worldwide and well paid too – making development a great career
        option. It is one of the easiest accessible higher paid fields as you do not need a traditional university
        degree to become qualified.

        The field of web development is generally broken down into front-end (the user-facing side) and back-end (the
        server side). Let’s delve into the details.</p>

    <p><strong>The first step is to decide which aspect of web development interests you and then start out with one
        programming language.

    </strong>
        For example, if you are interested in front end you can start by learning some HTML and CSS, then start working
        on projects as soon as you are comfortable with the basics. Our Web Developer Program is a perfect fit for this
        route. But others may suite you as well.

        It also helps to join a discussion group or community of other web developers, so that you can troubleshoot,
        discuss ideas and get inspiration.
